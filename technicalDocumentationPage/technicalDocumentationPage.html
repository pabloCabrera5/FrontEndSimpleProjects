                    What Is Amazon DynamoDB?
                </header>
                <p>
                    Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable
                    performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens of
                    operating and scaling a distributed database so that you don't have to worry about hardware
                    provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling. DynamoDB
                    also offers encryption at rest, which eliminates the operational burden and complexity involved in
                    protecting sensitive data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data and
                    serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity
                    without downtime or performance degradation. You can use the AWS Management Console to monitor
                    resource utilization and performance metrics.

                    Core Components
                </header>
                <p>
                    In DynamoDB, tables, items, and attributes are the core components that you work with. A table is a
                    collection of items, and each item is a collection of attributes. DynamoDB uses primary keys to
                    uniquely identify each item in a table and secondary indexes to provide more querying flexibility.
                    You can use DynamoDB Streams to capture data modification events in DynamoDB tables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tables, Items, and Attributes
                    The following are the basic DynamoDB components:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tables</strong> – Similar to other database systems, DynamoDB stores data in tables. A
                        table is a collection of data. For example, see the example table called People that you could
                        use to store personal contact information about friends, family, or anyone else of interest. You
                        could also have a Cars table to store information about vehicles that people drive.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Items</strong> – Each table contains zero or more items. An item is a group of
                        attributes that is uniquely identifiable among all of the other items. In a People table, each
                        item represents a person. For a Cars table, each item represents one vehicle. Items in DynamoDB
                        are similar in many ways to rows, records, or tuples in other database systems. In DynamoDB,
                        there is no limit to the number of items you can store in a table.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Attributes</strong> – Each item is composed of one or more attributes. An attribute is a
                        fundamental data element, something that does not need to be broken down any further. For
                        example, an item in a People table contains attributes called PersonID, LastName, FirstName, and
                        so on. For a Department table, an item might have attributes such as DepartmentID, Name,
                        Manager, and so on. Attributes in DynamoDB are similar in many ways to fields or columns in
                        other database systems.

                    Primary Key & Secondary Indexes
                </header>
                <p>
                    When you create a table, in addition to the table name, you must specify the primary key of the
                    table. The primary key uniquely identifies each item in the table, so that no two items can have the
                    same key.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DynamoDB supports two different kinds of primary keys:
                </p>
                <code></code>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Partition key</strong> – A simple primary key, composed of one attribute known as the
                        partition key.

                        DynamoDB uses the partition key's value as input to an internal hash function. The output from
                        the hash function determines the partition (physical storage internal to DynamoDB) in which the
                        item will be stored.

                        In a table that has only a partition key, no two items can have the same partition key value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Partition key and sort key</strong> – Referred to as a composite primary key, this type
                        of key is composed of two attributes. The first attribute is the partition key, and the second
                        attribute is the sort key.

                        DynamoDB uses the partition key value as input to an internal hash function. The output from the
                        hash function determines the partition (physical storage internal to DynamoDB) in which the item
                        will be stored. All items with the same partition key value are stored together, in sorted order
                        by sort key value.

                        In a table that has a partition key and a sort key, it's possible for two items to have the same
                        partition key value. However, those two items must have different sort key values.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You can create one or more secondary indexes on a table. A secondary index lets you query the data
                    in the table using an alternate key, in addition to queries against the primary key. DynamoDB
                    doesn't require that you use indexes, but they give your applications more flexibility when querying
                    your data. After you create a secondary index on a table, you can read data from the index in much
                    the same way as you do from the table.
                </p>
                DynamoDB supports two kinds of indexes:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Global secondary index</strong> – An index with a partition key and sort key that can be
                        different from those on the table.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Local secondary index</strong> – An index that has the same partition key as the table,
                        but a different sort key.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Each table in DynamoDB has a limit of 20 global secondary indexes (default limit) and 5 local
                    secondary indexes per table.

                <p>
                    Tables are the fundamental data structures in relational databases and in Amazon DynamoDB. A
                    relational database management system (RDBMS) requires you to define the table's schema when you
                    create it. In contrast, DynamoDB tables are schemaless—other than the primary key, you do not need
                    to define any extra attributes or data types when you create a table.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use the <i>CreateTable</i> action to create a provisioned mode table, specifying parameters as shown
                    following:

                            {
